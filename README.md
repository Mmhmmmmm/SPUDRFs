Abstract: Deep discriminative models (e.g. deep regression forests, deep neural decision forests) have achieved remarkable success recently to solve problems such as facial age estimation and head pose estimation. Most existing methods pursue robust and unbiased solutions either through learning discriminative features, or reweighting samples. We argue what is more desirable is learning gradually to discriminate like our human beings, and hence we resort to self-paced learning (SPL). Then, a natural question arises: can self-paced regime lead deep discriminative models to achieve more robust and less biased solutions? To this end, we propose a new deep discriminative modelâ€”self-paced deep regression forests with consideration on underrepresented examples (SPUDRFs). It tackles the fundamental ranking and selecting problem in SPL from a new perspective: fairness. This paradigm is fundamental and could be easily combined with a variety of deep discriminative models (DDMs). Extensive experiments on two computer vision tasks, i.e., facial age estimation and head pose estimation, demonstrate the efficacy of SPUDRFs, where state-of-the-art performances are achieved.

## Performance  
### **Age Estimation on MORPH II Dataset**   
The MAEs of SP-DRFs and SPUDRFs at each pace descends gradually. The SPUDRFs show its superiority of taking predictive uncertainty into consideration, when compared with SP-DRFs.

### **Head Pose Estimation on Biwi Dataset**  
The leaf node distribution of SP-DRFs and SPUDRFs in gradual learning process. Three paces, i.e. pace 1, 3, and 6, are randomly chosen for visualization. For
SP-DRFs, the Gaussian means of leaf nodes (the red points in the second row) are concentrated in a small range, incurring seriously biased solutions. For SPUDRFs, the Gaussian means of leaf nodes (the orange points in the third row) distribute widely, leading to much better MAE performance.
